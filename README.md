# D3Maps
Learning D3 Maps

This project gathers steps and results for my individual learning path for rendering geomaps using D3js.

So far there is included:
- wm.html: renders a globe, iterarting over each country and highlights it
- wm2.html shall become the same like wm.html, but with a 2d (mercator) projection
